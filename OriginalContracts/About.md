The contracts contained in this folder have been simply copied from https://capturetheether.com, and all rights belong to their
author, SMARX. The reason for copying them here is to make this repository self-contained in case the capturetheether web
goes down or changes at some point.

Within the contracts, I have also included the description of the challenge as presented in the web.
