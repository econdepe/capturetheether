# Warmup

There are three exercises in this section. They're not really challenges, but rather tests that you know how to minimally
interact with smart contracts. I.e.: deploy them to a testnet and call their functions.

Most likely you don't need any guidance here. But it could happen that you understand smart contracts only at the
theoretical level, say from reading the docs. A couple of simple observations will get you started. These exercises are also
good for understanding the logic of the challenges we will find later.
